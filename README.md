Matlab scripts for read/write VASP output/input as well as read/write material studio XSD/XTD file.
The main function include:
* INCAR vasp input write
* KPOINTS vasp input write
* POSCAR vasp input write
* POTCAR vasp input write

* POSCAR/XDATCAR vasp output read (VASP_Config_Read)
* OSZICAR vasp output read
* OUTCAR vibrational frequency read

* XSD material studio file read
* XSD material studio file write
* XTD material studio animation file write

The repository also include outside code:
* grep
